# Some features

- Query Specifications / Repositories / Unit Of Work
- MediatR with handlers and the likes
- EntraID-ready, just add your configuration in appsettings.json

# Static code quality analysis

- ReSharper config, easy to configure
- Roslyn Analyzers

# Testing

- Unit tests with xUnit
- Quality Tests

# My idea

- I think we should keep domain and presentation as layers, not in the features. Usually, features and these concepts are not 1=1
